# Network_analysis
Implemented large-scale network flow analysis (171K+ flows) to extract traffic statistics, detect anomalies, and identify heavy communicators.

Applied probabilistic data structures (HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch, Bloom Filter) for memory-efficient IP estimation and frequency analysis.

Built anomaly and threat detection pipeline: spotted traffic spikes, suspicious communication patterns, stealthy port scans, slow DDoS attempts, IP hopping, and malware C2 behaviors.
